# Furnace

## About
**Furnace** is a spigot plugin-based modding framework.
It aims to provide a modded-like experience without needing modded clients.
This opens the world of modded Minecraft up to many who are not capable or willing to install mods.

## How does it work?
**Furnace** uses resource packs to add thousands of custom items and blocks.
Server-side code adds the functionality to these custom elements.

## Why would I use this over Forge?
Forge requires all players to install the server's mods on their local client.
This is an inconvenience and usually is only done by the more technical players.
**Furnace** allows all Minecraft players to experience playing with mods with no technical knowledge needed.
**Furnace** is not as powerful as Forge, but can emulate the majority of its features.

## Can I use Forge mods with this?
No.
**Furnace** mods need to be written specifically for the framework.
The vast majority of Forge's functionality is implemented differently in **Furnace**, so making the APIs compatible won't happen anytime soon.

## How do I install **Furnace** mods?
You can't yet. The framework is not in a usable form at this stage in development.

## How do I develop mods for **Furnace**?
You can't yet. The framework is not in a usable form at this stage in development.
